  <p> A Letter To My Bestieee</p>
  <p>Where do I even begin? Words can’t fully express how much you truly mean to me.When our friendship first started, we didn’t really have much in common, and honestly, we didn’t always get along the best either. But despite that, I always had this feeling that we would eventually click...</p>

  <p>I still remember all the times you’d ask me, “Brian, do you think we’ll be friends for a long time?” You’d talk about how different we were our interests, our personalities, even our moods. But it was never our differences that were a problem. If anything, our chemistry beat all those odds. Your bright, bubbly personality mixed with my dual realness (lol) somehow created the perfect balance.</p>

  <p>You made it easier for me to smile on days when I wasn’t happy, , and easier to laugh when I felt like nothing could. I still can’t fully put it into words, but it’s always been easy for me to see you as someone incredibly close to my heart like family… like a sister. I never felt any shame or embarrassment around you, and I always knew I could be my real self.

I want to thank you for always being there for me, and for coming into my life when you did. That was one of the hardest times I’ve ever gone through, and I felt incredibly alone before you showed up. Because of that, I truly thank God for placing you in my circle..</p>

  <p>With that being said, I want to wish you the happiest 23rd birthday, and I pray that you’re blessed with many, many more!!!</p>

  <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I hope this gets the job done because I am BROKEEEEEEEE 😂<br>
  I love you so much, Kay.<br>
